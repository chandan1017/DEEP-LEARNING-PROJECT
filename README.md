## üìù Project Overview

As part of my internship at CodTech, I completed Task 2: Deep Learning ‚Äì Image Classification, where I developed a basic image classification model using PyTorch to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The objective was to build a functional system capable of learning visual features from a training dataset and accurately classifying new images. I used Python 3.13 and tools like Torchvision for image transformations and dataset handling, with development carried out in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The dataset was organized into two folders, each containing 4 images of cats and dogs respectively, with an additional test_images folder used for evaluating the model. I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and trained the model for 5 epochs, achieving an accuracy of 75% on the small dataset. The model successfully classified test images such as c.jpeg as a cat and d.jpeg as a dog, demonstrating its ability to learn visual patterns. Through this project, I gained practical experience in deep learning concepts like CNN design, data preprocessing, training and validation, and model evaluation. This task provided valuable exposure to the image classification workflow and reinforced my understanding of how deep learning techniques are applied in real-world applications such as medical imaging, security systems, wildlife recognition, and mobile apps.
